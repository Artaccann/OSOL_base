# ch1_joke_yes

Doctor: Alright.

Doctor: Here is a joke.

Doctor: A man walks into a bar with a tiny piano and a tiny man playing it. The bartender, intrigued, asks, "Hey, where did you get that?" The man pulls out an old, dusty lamp and says, "I found this. It's got a genie inside who grants wishes, but there's a catch." The bartender, excited, grabs the lamp, rubs it, and a genie appears. "You have one wish," the genie booms. The bartender quickly says, "I wish for a million bucks!" Suddenly, the bar fills with ducks—thousands and thousands of ducks, quacking and flying everywhere. The bartender looks at the man in shock. The man sighs and says, "Yeah… you think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?"

Doctor: Hahaha.

Doctor: [neutral]: Now. This is the end.

Doctor: Really.

Doctor: Really, really.

Doctor [angry]: *ugh*

Doctor: Goodbye.
